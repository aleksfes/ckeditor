			<h3>Interpretations</h3>
			<div id="interpret" contenteditable="true">
				<h4>Wolf attacks</h4>
				<p>
					Ethologist Valerius Geist of the University of Calgary, Alberta wrote that the fable was likely based on genuine risk of wolf attacks at the time. He argues that wolves were in fact dangerous predators, and fables served as a valid warning not to enter forests where wolves were known to live, and to be on the look out for such. Both wolves and wilderness were treated as enemies of humanity in that region and time.
				</p>
				<h4>Natural cycles</h4>
				<p>Folklorists and cultural anthropologists such as P. Saintyves and Edward Burnett Tylor saw "Little Red Riding Hood" in terms of solar myths and other naturally-occurring cycles. Her red hood could represent the bright sun which is ultimately swallowed by the terrible night (the wolf), and the variations in which she is cut out of the wolf's belly represent by it the dawn. In this interpretation, there is a connection between the wolf of this tale and Sköll, the wolf in Norse myth that will swallow the personified Sun at Ragnarök, or Fenrir. Alternatively, the tale could be about the season of spring, or the month of May, escaping the winter.</p>
				<h4>Ritual</h4>
				<p>The tale has been interpreted as a puberty ritual, stemming from a prehistorical origin (sometimes an origin stemming from a previous matriarchal era). The girl, leaving home, enters a liminal state and by going through the acts of the tale, is transformed into an adult woman by the act of coming out of the wolf's belly.</p>

				&quot;<b>Little Red Riding Hood</b>&quot; is a famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_tale"

				wolf. The story has been changed considerably in its history and subject to numerous
				modern adaptations and readings.</p>

				<p>
					The version most widely known today is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Grimm"
						title="Brothers Grimm">Brothers Grimm</a> variant. It is about a girl called
					Little Red Riding Hood, after the red <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hood_%28headgear%29"
						title="Hood (headgear)">hooded</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape" title="Cape">
							cape</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloak" title="Cloak">cloak</a>
					she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sick grandmother.</p>
				<p>
					A wolf wants to eat the girl but is afraid to do so in public. He approaches the
					girl, and she na&iuml;vely tells him where she is going. He suggests the girl pick
					some flowers, which she does. In the meantime, he goes to the grandmother&#39;s
					house and gains entry by pretending to be the girl. He swallows the grandmother
					whole, and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandmother.</p>
				<p>
					When the girl arrives, she notices he looks very strange to be her grandma. In most
					retellings, this eventually culminates with Little Red Riding Hood saying, &quot;My,
					what big teeth you have!&quot;<br />
					To which the wolf replies, &quot;The better to eat you with,&quot; and swallows
					her whole, too.</p>
				<p>
					A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter" title="Hunter">hunter</a>, however,
					comes to the rescue and cuts the wolf open. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother
					emerge unharmed. They fill the wolf&#39;s body with heavy stones, which drown him
					when he falls into a well. Other versions of the story have had the grandmother
					shut in the closet instead of eaten, and some have Little Red Riding Hood saved
					by the hunter as the wolf advances on her rather than after she is eaten.</p>
				<p>
					The tale makes the clearest contrast between the safe world of the village and the
					dangers of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_forest" title="Enchanted forest">
						forest</a>, conventional antitheses that are essentially medieval, though no
					written versions are as old as that.</p>
