Changes described in this file are supposed to be definitive. For these we need
to either provide a compatibility plugin or clearly document them.

Changes not included here are instead pending analysis and v3 porting.

The documentation (including API docs) needed to be checked to be sure it
reflects the changes.

===============================================================================

CKEDITOR.event.fire now returns the boolean "false" if the event has been
cancelled (in v3 it returns "true").

---

The listener function sent to CKEDITOR.event.on can now return the boolean
"false" to cancel the event. I'm not sure this will bring any impact, but it's
better to have it documented, at least.

---

The CKEDITOR.replaceByClassEnabled option is not anymore available. Now it's
enough to set CKEDITOR.replaceClass to empty/null to disable the auto-replace.

---

The default value for config.docType is "<!DOCTYPE html>" (the HTML5 doctype).

---

CKEDITOR.config.corePlugins is not any more available. Core plugins must be
simply loaded after core.

---

The editor will now support only one skin in a single page (all editor will use
the same skin).

Because of the above, the following skin related properties have been deleted:

	- CKEDITOR.editor::skinName => now CKEDITOR.skin.name
	- CKEDITOR.editor::skinPath => now CKEDITOR.skin.getPath( 'editor' )
	- CKEDITOR.editor::skinClass => deprecated

---

"new CKEDITOR.dom.range( document, root )" changed to "new CKEDITOR.dom.range( root )".

---

The legacy "selection" and "styles" plugin have been moved to the core API and are not any more available as plugins.
