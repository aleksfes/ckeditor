Changes described in this file are supposed to be definitive. For these we need
to either provide a compatibility plugin or clearly document them.

Changes not included here are instead pending analysis and v3 porting.

The documentation (including API docs) needed to be checked to be sure it
reflects the changes.

===============================================================================

CKEDITOR.event.fire now returns the boolean "false" if the event has been
canceled (in v3 it returns "true").

---

The listener function sent to CKEDITOR.event.on can now return the boolean
"false" to cancel the event. I'm not sure this will bring any impact, but it's
better to have it documented, at least.

---

The CKEDITOR.replaceByClassEnabled option is not anymore available. Now it's
enough to set CKEDITOR.replaceClass to empty/null to disable the auto-replace.

---

The default value for config.docType is "<!DOCTYPE html>" (the HTML5 doctype).

---

CKEDITOR.config.corePlugins is not any more available. Core plugins must be
simply loaded after core.

---

The editor will now support only one skin in a single page (all editors will use
the same skin).

Because of the above, the following skin related properties have been deleted:

	- CKEDITOR.editor::skinName => now CKEDITOR.skin.name
	- CKEDITOR.editor::skinPath => now CKEDITOR.skin.getPath( 'editor' )
	- CKEDITOR.editor::skinClass => deprecated

---

"new CKEDITOR.dom.range( document, root )" changed to "new CKEDITOR.dom.range( root )".

---

The legacy "selection" and "styles" plugin have been moved to the core API and
are not any more available as plugins.

---

On plugin language files, the usual CKEDITOR.plugins.setLang call now enforces
a namespace in the format editor.lang.pluginName, which contains the provided
language entries.

So, in CKEditor 3 we had:

	CKEDITOR.plugins.setLang( 'myplugin', 'en',
	{
		myplugin :
		{
			title : 'My Plugin'
		}
	});

In CKEditor 4, the above will make the entry accessible at
editor.lang.myplugin.myplugin.title, so it must be changed to:

	CKEDITOR.plugins.setLang( 'myplugin', 'en',
	{
		title : 'My Plugin'
	});

In this way the entry will be available at editor.lang.myplugin.title.
---

Constructor CKEDITOR.editor now receives two additional params: element and elementMode,
in order to simplify creator implementation, now in form of CKEDITOR.editor( config, element, elementMode ),
all params are optional though.

---

The "iconOffset" property, used for button definitions, must now point to the
exact offset position of the image in the icon file, instead of its logical order.

For example, in CKEditor 3 its value could be set to "2". Now, in that same
case, it should be set to "-32" (2 x -16).

---

The default value for config.toolbarCanCollapse has been changed to "false".

---

The editor.getThemeSpace() method has been renamed to editor.space().

---

The "themeSpace" event has been replaced with "uiSpace".

---

The evt.data.html and evt.data.text properties are not any more available with
the paste event. They have been replaced by a single evt.data.data property and
additional properties (evt.data.type and evt.data.htmlified) have been added to help identify the data type.

---

The editor.insertText() does not any more serve for inserting plain text into the editor
(it does not "htmlify" it). Instead, editor.paste() and paste event itself took over
this responsibility. The editor.insertText(), like other methods: editor.insertHtml() and insertElement(),
handles only the insertion process.
